Configuration notes
-------------------

btcd
  The connection details for your Bitcoin Core node.
  "url" is host:port. If ckpool and bitcoind are in the same Docker Compose
  stack, use the service name as the hostname (e.g. "bitcoind:8332").
  If bitcoind is on the host machine, use the Docker bridge IP (typically
  172.17.0.1) or --network host.

btcaddress
  The Bitcoin address that receives the block reward when your pool finds a
  block. This is YOUR wallet address - all friends and family share the reward
  because they are contributing hashrate to a single pool account.
  Set to your address: 32coLSLp3xNAajDZtxvPim5XahrxWRGBAy

btcsig
  An optional string embedded in the coinbase transaction of any block your
  pool mines. Limited to a short ASCII string. Shows up on block explorers
  as a vanity tag identifying your pool.

serverurl
  The address and port miners connect to. "0.0.0.0:3333" binds to all
  interfaces. Tell your friends/family to point their miners to:
    stratum+tcp://<your-server-ip>:3333
  Username and password can be anything (e.g. worker1 / x).

mindiff / startdiff / maxdiff
  Difficulty controls for vardiff (variable difficulty).
  - mindiff: lowest difficulty a miner can be assigned. 256 suits most modern
    ASIC and GPU miners. Lower it (e.g. 64) if anyone is using weak hardware.
  - startdiff: difficulty new miners start at before vardiff adjusts them.
    Match this to mindiff for fast initial adjustment.
  - maxdiff: cap the maximum difficulty. 0 means no cap (recommended).
  Vardiff will automatically tune each miner's difficulty to target roughly
  one share every few seconds regardless of their hashrate.

logdir
  Directory where pool logs are written. /config/logs means logs appear in
  your bind-mounted config directory on the host.

dropidle
  Disconnects miners that have submitted no shares for this many seconds.
  3600 = 1 hour. Set to 0 to disable.

update_interval
  How often (in seconds) the pool sends new work to miners. 30 seconds is
  the default and is fine for a private pool.

donation
  Percentage of block rewards donated to the ckpool developer (Con Kolivas).
  The pool software also has a hardcoded 0.5% developer contribution built in.
  Setting this to 0 disables the optional additional donation.
